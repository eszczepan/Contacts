# Contacts

A project that shows a list of contacts in alphabetical order fetched from external API. This is a Progressive Web Application which means it is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser, including both desktop and mobile devices. In the application, you can search for contacts by first and last name and you can also select them by using checkboxes.
